# Requirements
Before you build the program, you need to install the Java 8 JDK. Once you have done so, you need to add the path to your environment variables.

# Building
To build the program, open up your terminal and navigate to the root folder. Then, navigate to /Build/ou-cs-cg.   
Once you have done this, type the command `./gradlew installDist` and hit enter.  
This will compile and build the program. You can run `./gradlew clean` to remove the compiled binaries.

# Running
After you have built the program, you can run it by going to /Build/ou-cs-cg/build/install/project/bin in your file explorere and double-clicking either  
`project` for MacOS/Linux, or `project.sbatch` for Windows. This will bring up a new window which contains the program.
