# Running
After you have built the program, you can run it by going to /Build/ou-cs-cg/build/install/project/bin in your file explorere and double-clicking either  
`project` for MacOS/Linux, or `project.sbatch` for Windows. This will bring up a new window which contains the program.

# Controls
- To select an algorithm, click the drop down menu in the center of the toolbar and then select your desired option
- To select a start node, click inside any node (red circle) shown. It will turn blue to indicate it is the start
- To select an end node, shift-click inside any node shown. It will turn magenta to indicate it is the end. This option is only available when shortest-path is selected
- To run the currently selected algorithm, press "Start the Visualizer" button on the left of the toolbar. This only works if there is not an algorithm currently being displayed
- To clear a currently displayed algorithm, press 'Q'
- To toggle the edge weights, press 'W'
- To slow down the animation speed, press 'A'. To speed it up press 'S'
- To pause the animation, press space
- To zoom in and out, use the mouse scroll wheel/trackpad zoom
- To pan, use the arrow keys. Holding shift will pan by smaller amounts
- To reset panning and zooming, press 'C'
- To randomize the graph, press the "Randomize the Graph" button on the right of the toolbar. This only works if there is not an algorithm currently being displayed
- To go back to the default graph, press 'D'
